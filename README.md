🔍 What is Askify?
* Askify is like having a personal AI tutor sitting beside you.
* You can ask it questions by typing or speaking, and it will:
* 🧑‍🏫 Explain your question in a simple, classroom-style way.
* 🔊 Read out the explanation in a natural human-like voice using MurfAI.
* 📝 Summarize the key points into short, bullet-style notes for revision.
* So instead of scrolling through long articles or struggling with technical jargon, Askify explains things the way a teacher would — clear, short, and with relatable examples.

🎯 Why did we build this?
* Students often face 3 problems while learning:
* ❌ Too much text, not enough clarity
* – Explanations online can be lengthy or complicated.
* ❌ No one to teach it like a teacher
* – Reading isn’t the same as being explained concepts in a classroom style.
* ❌ Poor revision methods
* – Students spend extra time writing notes, instead of just learning.
* 👉 Askify solves all three. It listens, explains, speaks, and summarizes automatically.
